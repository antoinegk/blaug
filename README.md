# Blaug
## A copy of a tutorial web app

I'm using this repo for three things:
 
* Practicing Git
* Experimenting with Ruby on Rails
* practicing with Continuous Development environments

This is not meant to be secure (yet). If it ever will be, it will be under the "Security" branch, which may or may not exist at any point in time.
